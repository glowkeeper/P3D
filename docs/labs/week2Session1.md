# Lab - Week 2, Session 1 - Modelling through ProBuilder

The lab focuses on:

+ Installing [ProBuilder](https://unity.com/features/probuilder)
+ Creating a basic model of a two-story building, using ProBuilder

## Overview

[ProBuilder](https://unity3d.com/unity/features/worldbuilding/probuilder) is a unique hybrid of 3D modelling and level design - it allows you to build, edit, and texture custom geometry, so that you can prototype and create interesting scenes.
