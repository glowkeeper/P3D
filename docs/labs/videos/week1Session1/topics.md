Welcome to the Programming for 3D lab session.

## Integrating Unity with GitHub

The lab focuses on:

+ Creating a GitHub repository, which you'll use to store your work
+ Cloning that repository to your local hard drive
+ Creating a Unity project in that local repository
+ Pushing your work up to GitHub - something you should continuously do while working on this module
