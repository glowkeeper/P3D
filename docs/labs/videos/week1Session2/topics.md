# Week 1, Session 2

Welcome to the Programming for 3D lab session.

## Agile Project Management

The lab focuses on:

+ Creating a GitHub project, which you'll use to plan your work
+ Creating a Kanban board within that project (and adding additional _Backlog_ and _In Review_ columns)
+ Creating project issues (tasks)
+ Adding those issues to Kanban columns
+ Finding inspiration for a two-story building that will form the basis of the project (and your coursework)
