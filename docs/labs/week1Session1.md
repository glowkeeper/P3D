# Lab for Week 1, Session 1 - Setting Up Your Environment

This lab's primary aim is to set up your environment so you can complete the rest of the module.

Once you have your environment set up, you should read some background material explaining [3D Graphics](../graphicsBackground.md) since that will help you get a much better understanding of the core concepts that make [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) work.

## Overview

This session requires you to install [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases), set up a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and create a GitHub project for the rest of your work on the module.

### GitHub

You should create a student account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) (if you still need to do so) and create a _private_ repository for your P3D work (you may wish to make it public later so that the repository forms part of your portfolio that you can show to potential employers). Finally, you should add the [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Programmingfor3D#maintainer) as a collaborator to that repository (GitHub username _glowkeeper_) so they can support you throughout the module.

Then, you should create a [GitHub project](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects) for managing your work on the module. Ultimately, the project board will be a marked content of your coursework - only those created and maintained from **now** have the potential for full marks in the marking criteria for the project component of your coursework.

If you have not used GitHub before, then there is a [Panopto recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=57307baa-f78e-42a8-8e5c-ac40012ddc4a) of a lecture about GitHub that the  [Module Convenor](https://github.com/glowkeeper/Programmingfor3D#maintainer) gave in previous years. You can also access the [lecture slides](../githubPresentation.pdf).

### Unity

The goal of the first six weeks of this module is to get _everyone_ to a reasonable level with an industry-leading platform for creating and operating interactive, 3D content - **Unity**. Please ensure you have installed the latest version of [Unity with long-term support](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

For some on this module, Unity will be new. Others will have used Unity as part of a group project, but they will not have been the key driver of that project, so the concepts presented here will still be relatively new. Yet others will already have a fair amount of experience - if that's you, you should not treat the first six weeks of this module as a free ride - _it is an opportunity for you to deepen your knowledge_ by working on the _Extended Material_ in the labs.
