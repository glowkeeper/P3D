# Week 1 Session 2 - Creating a Game Design Document

The goal of this session is to record in a game design document (GDD) some ideas about the game you will create during this module. The GDD will form the basis for your lab sessions and coursework.

## A Game Design Document

A GDD is a guiding vision that communicates ideas and becomes part of the software development process. It is descriptive, dynamic and live (kept up-to-date and iterated). If you're working in a team, it's collaboratively created, edited and updated by core development team members, including lead designers, artists and programmers. This collaborative effort forms the basis for bringing the game into reality.

A GDD might also become part of a publishing agreement. When a game publisher commissions a game following a successful pitch, a GDD is often attached to the agreement, whereby the development team has to adhere to the document during the game development process.

The document should communicate the ideas in a manner that works for you or your team (and publisher). It's a flexible tool that empowers creative expression most effectively. It can include descriptive prose, sketches, concept art, flow charts, reference images and videos and might even link to working, interactive builds representing core concepts; whatever gets the game from the idea stage to an actual build that constantly evolves.

## Exercise

Create your GDD! That will form the basis of the following lab (and the rest of the module), where you will pitch the ideas in your GDD to the moderator and support and begin planning to bring those ideas into being. You can imagine creating any game, but the pitch may reduce the idea's scope since the concept has to be achievable in the timeframe. Furthermore, you must intend to model some structure or building, which should form the basis of your game.

## Links

[Here is the GDD template](./docs/GameDesignDocumentTemplate.md) your moderator used to create ideas for the game he intends to build during P3D. And here is the [first draft of their GDD](./docs/GameDesignDocument.md). However, that template is not the only way to do it, so you should research and create something that works for you.

Here are some links to some GDDs used in some of the more famous games ever made:
