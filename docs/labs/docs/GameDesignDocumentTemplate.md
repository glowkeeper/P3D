# Game Design Document GDD

A GDD is the overview of the game, its storyline, a sketch of its main characters, the environment, the sound, the gameplay and the UI. And perhaps more, besides - whatever works for you to get the game up and running!

GDDs are part of the process, not an end in themselves. Do what you need to communicate ideas and structures. Keep your communication lean by picking the best medium for each bit of information. Draw sketches, make a flow chart, and put reference images and videos to support your opinion. And whenever you can, build things with interactivity to represent your concepts. And make this a living document by keeping it updated as you learn more. So iterate!

## Game Overview

Below is the game's one-line pitch, genre, graphical perspective, target audience, influences, player objectives and distinctive features.

### ​Pitch

Start with a one-sentence pitch for your game.

### ​Genre/Theme

Explain the primary genre for your game: Role-playing, Strategy, Sports, Adventure, Action, Simulation, Puzzle, Management, or something else entirely? What is the central theme/ setting of the game?

### ​Graphical Perspective

Explain player perspective: first-person, third-person, top-down, mixed?

Your work on Programming for 3D should include a third-person perspective.

### ​Target Audience

Describe your core audience, including age, gender, platform and the other games they played. Include the same for a secondary audience, if relevant.

### ​Game Influences

State the key game influences, including other games, books, films, TV, etc.

### ​Player Objectives

What are the player's main goals, and how can they be achieved?

### ​Distinctive Features

What makes this game different from other games?

## ​The Story

Below are the premise, narrative, missions and choice points underpinning the game.

### ​The Premise

What is the situation before the game starts? What does the player need to know to understand the fantasy context in which the game takes place?

### ​In-game Narrative

How does the story move along during the game? What is the player trying to achieve, and what are the major events that take place between the start and end?

### ​Missions/Challenges

What are the major challenges or obstacles the player will face in the game?

### ​Choice points

If there is a branching narrative, what are the major points where the player has a choice to make? What are the implications of the choices made? Are there different endings to the game depending on the choices made?

## Characters

The player characters, enemies, and allies are described below.

### Player Characters

What characters or other controlled devices, e.g., groups of creatures, cars, shapes, etc., does the player take control of? What are the player character's key features/capabilities, and do these change over the course of the game?

### Enemies

What are the opposing forces in the game? If the obstacles are not purely environmental, who are the enemy non-player characters (NPCs), what dangers do they face, and how can they be defeated, etc.?

### Allies

Does the player have allies in the game? If so, what are their characteristics, how can they help, and is teaming up with friendly NPCs essential or optional?

## ​Environment

Below is the structure and levels of the game.

### ​Game Structure

How many environments/levels does the game take place over? What are the key puzzles/enemies/ obstacles to be overcome?

For Programming for 3D, keep the structure simple - aim for a single level during the lab sessions. However, you might be required to expand on that level later, so you should keep that in mind.

### ​Levels and Locations

Describe the key levels/locations and their themes/features.

## Sound

Below is a description of the main audio components used in the game.

### Diegetic

Diegetic sound emanates directly from the action within the game; hence, it's sometimes referred to as 'actual sound'. Its origin is the Greek diḗgēsis, meaning 'narration, narrative'.

### Non-diegetic

Non-diegetic sound is audio that does not emanate directly from the action; in other words, it's the type of sound characters in a game would not hear, but we players can. Audio designers use non-diegetic sound to create exaggerated effects that add to the drama.

## ​Gameplay

Below are the main gameplay elements.

### ​Mechanics

What are the core game mechanics? What will the player do to solve the main obstacles in the game?

### ​Movement

How does the player move around the game world? Does this change or alter at any point?

### ​Controls

What external hardware is required to play the game, and how does this map to the game controls?

### ​Weapons

Does your game have weapons? If so, what kinds are used? How are they used? How does ammunition work? Are there upgrades? etc.?

### ​Inventory

Is there an inventory system? If so, how does it work and how is it accessed?

## Graphical User Interface

Below is a description of the GUI

### ​Maps and Views

What maps and views are available to the player?

### ​Heads Up Display (HUD)

What features are on the HUD? Does this change in different gameplay contexts or throughout the game?

### ​Menus

What menus do you need, and how are they accessed?
