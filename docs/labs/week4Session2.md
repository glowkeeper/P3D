## Overview

This lab serves as an introduction to particle systems in Unity, using [Visual Effects Graphs](https://unity.com/visual-effect-graph).

Particle systems first came into being via the 1982 film _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, whey they used a particle system for the fictional "Genesis effect"; now, they're used to create complex nebulous simulated animations for effects such as liquids, fire, fireworks, smoke and weather, which they achieve by combining individual particles in the form of textures, material instances and entities.

You can create particle systems in Unity in several ways; visual effect graphs are the most intuitive, because they allow you to author visual effects using easily customisable node-based visual logic, similarly to [Shader Graphs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@15.0/manual/index.html), which we looked at in a prior lab; hence, you already have some exerience of this node-based visual logic.
