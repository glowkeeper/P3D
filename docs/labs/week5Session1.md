# Lab - Week 5, Session 1 - Animations in Unity

This lab focuses on:

+ Keyframe Animations
+ Simple Scripting

## Overview

With Unity [animations](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html), you can animate game objects using traditional [keyframe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame) animation techniques. Keyframes are timeline points containing data about a game object's position or scale. Essentially keyframes indicate a change that produces an animation so that, when it plays, Unity can interpolate the data from one keyframe to the next, thus animating the object.

The scripts created in this lab are simple scripts for controlling the animation. They will serve as an introduction to Unity scripting, thus allowing us to look at scripting more deeply in the next lab.
