# Lab - Week 3, Session 2 - 3D Physics in Unity

The lab focuses on:

+ Rigidbodies
+ Kinematics
+ Colliders
+ Static and Dynamic Colliders
+ Physics Materials
+ Triggers

This lab demonstrates Unity's [built-in 3D Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/PhysicsOverview.html), and not the recently-out-of-preview [Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS)](https://unity.com/dots). Besides, DOTS is aimed at large, complex applications/games; for smaller applications (such as the ones we'll be building in the labs), Unity's built-in 3D physics platform remains the best choice. However, should you be using DOTS already, then you are welcome to use that for your coursework.

## Overview

In this setting, 3D physics refers to the properties of objects and how they respond to forces. Unity's built-in physics engine has a breadth of tools that ensure objects can interact with other objects by approximating natural forces, such as gravity, velocity, acceleration, and friction. Figure 1 shows the properties of Unity's 3D physics engine.

### Rigidbodies

Figure 2 shows that a rigidbody is the main component that enables physical behaviour for a game object. A rigidbody is a term borrowed from the realworld - it is an idealised object that does not deform under the influence of external forces; instead, it maintains its shape and size, making it ideal for analysing mechanical systems in physics and engineering (and also for modelling idealised physical systems in Unity!).

A Unity rigidbody also detects and resolves collisions between colliders (see below).

Since a rigidbody component is responsible for the movement of the game object to which it attached, you shouldn't try to move the game object by changing its _Transform_ properties in a script (we'll look at scripting later in the module). Instead, you should [apply forces to push the GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RigidbodiesOverview.html) and let the physics engine calculate the results.

#### Kinematics

Kinematic is the branch of mechanics that deals with bodiesâ€™ movement. It describes their motion without getting into the causes of motion, such as gravitational force, and torque.

That is why When something is _Kinematic_ in Unity, the physics behaviour of its rigidbody component is disabled, so it does not get affected by external forces; a _Kinematic Rigidbody_ can still push another rigidbody, but it cannot be pushed. Importantly, A _Kinematic Rigidbody_ still collides with other rigid bodies - that makes them ideal for platforms and elevators, because you want such things to maintain a path while still having the ability to transport that which they've collided (such as a player controller).

### Colliders

Colliders allow Unity to register when two objects interact. They define the [physical collision shape of a game object](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CollidersOverview.html), such that, a game object will react to incoming collisions if it has a rigidbody component that is associated with one or more _Collider_ components. Colliders are invisible and do not need to match the shape of their associated game object mesh. The primitive _colliders_, _Box Collider_, _Sphere Collider_ and _Capsule Collider_ are the most straightforward and least processor-intensive.

#### Static and Dynamic Colliders

Game objects with colliders without a rigidbody are **static**, in that they won't move when they interact with other colliders; hence, they're useful for modelling motionless scene objects, such as walls and floors.

A game object that has a rigidbody and a collider are known as dynamic.

#### Physics Materials

When colliders interact, their surfaces should simulate the properties of the material they are supposed to represent. For example, a pane of glass should be slippery, but a rubber ball should not; however, it should be bouncy! Physics materials allow the configuration of the friction and bounce of the colliders to which they're attached.

### Triggers

_Triggers_ function similarly to _colliders_. However, when _triggers_ interact with _colliders_, they are ignored by the physics engine. Instead, they can execute scripts, which means they are useful for triggering all types of events; examples are some action when a _collider_ enters an area, tutorial messages or [cutscenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutscene). You will take advantage of _triggers_ later in the module.
