# Lab - Week 1, Session 2 - Agile Project Management

The lab focuses on:

+ Creating a GitHub project, which you'll use to plan your work
+ Creating a Kanban board within that project (and adding additional _Backlog_ and _In Review_ columns)
+ Creating project issues (tasks)
+ Adding those issues to Kanban columns
+ Finding inspiration for a two-story building that will form the basis of the project (and your coursework)

## Overview

[Agile project management](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management) is a planning method often used to build and maintain software. A full agile project will feature [epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) and [ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/ceremonies) like [standups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), [sprint planning](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning), [sprint reviews](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-reviews) (to get stakeholder feedback) and [retrospectives](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/retrospectives). [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) boards enable software developers to use a process of continuous development, through cards and columns, to help visualise the work that needs to be done.

## Project Kanban Board

Now you must visit the _Project_ tab on your GitHub repository and set up the Kanban board that you will use to plan your lab sessions, and ultimately, manage the development of your coursework.
