# Week 5, Session 2 - Animations

This session aims to get you to use [keyframe animations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame) in your scenes.

## Unity Animations

With Unity [animations](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationSection.html), you can animate game objects using traditional keyframe animation techniques. Keyframes are timeline points containing data about a game object's position or scale. Essentially, keyframes indicate a change that produces an animation so that, when it plays, Unity can interpolate the data from one keyframe to the next, thus animating the object.

## Exercise

Animate something in your scene - perhaps some GameObject growing and then shrinking, or some other GameObject moving from one place to another - whatever makes sense in your scene.
