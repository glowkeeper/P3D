# Lab - Week 6, Session 2 - Creative Thinking

This lab focuses on:

+ Creative Thinking

## Overview

Programming for 3D is a module that falls into the realm of science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM). Many think of STEM activities as the opposite of creativity, but that's an incorrect misconception! Many of the best programmers have a creative side (they practice martial arts, paint, draw, write or play a musical instrument); besides, the act of envisaging the architecture and solution to a highly complex programming problem often requires extreme creativity. So, it's a good idea to exercise your creative self (there are ideas for that below).

Although creative inspiration can be hard to pin down, there are two types of triggers for inspiration: intrapsychic and environmental. First, intrapsychic triggers are connections between two known ideas. Environmental triggers are externalities you notice that connect with something you already know. Studies have shown that [the inspired human brain goes through a process](https://www.betterup.com/blog/how-to-get-inspired/) involving an interplay between the network of neurons that activates when you daydream and the network of neurons that governs high-level conscious tasks. Creative ideas spark when those two networks interact, so inspiration works both by focusing your attention and letting your imagination run wild - a creative contradiction if ever there was one!

In other words (and somewhat ironically), creative thinking does not necessarily require you to have an original idea - instead, it requires you to draw inspiration from elsewhere or connect that which is known; in that sense, it mimics much of academia and science because that requires you to _Stand on the Shoulders of Giants_ by developing prior work and connecting creative concepts.

So, with all that in mind, are there creative tools that can help foster inspiration? Below is a curated compendium of ideas; I hope they inspire _you_!
