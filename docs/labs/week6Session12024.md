# Week 6, Session 1 - Particle Systems with Visual Effects Graphs

This session aims to implement a particle system using [Visual Effects Graphs](https://unity.com/visual-effect-graph) in your scene.

## Particle Systems

Particle systems areÂ a type of animation created by using combinations of textures (a particle is any individual texture the particle system generates) that, when viewed together, form a more complex, nebulous simulation. They first came into being in the 1982 film _Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan_, which used a particle system for the _Genesis effect_, whereby a torpedo-shaped device initiated a process of rapid terraforming that turned previously uninhabitable planets into habitable worlds ready for colonisation. Star Trek sets the scene for what has come afterwards; nowadays, particle systems are often deployed to create similar "fuzzy" effects, such as liquids, fire, fireworks, smoke, and clouds.

You can create particle systems in Unity in several ways; visual effect graphs are the most intuitive because they allow you to author visual effects using easily customisable node-based visual logic, similar to [Shader Graphs](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/shader-graph.html).

## Exercise

Create a particle system that makes sense for your scene - perhaps a smoking fire or boiling water.
