# Week 2, Session 1 - Agile Project Management

The goal of this session is to create the project board that you can use to plan your work on Programming for 3D.

## Agile

[Agile project management](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management) is a planning method often used to build and maintain software. A full agile project will feature [epics](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/epics) and [ceremonies](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/ceremonies) like [standups](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/standups), [sprint planning](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-planning), [sprint reviews](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/sprint-reviews) (to get stakeholder feedback) and [retrospectives](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/retrospectives). [Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban) boards are a means by which agile software teams can use a process of continuous development through cards and columns to help visualise the work that needs to be done.

For Programming for 3D, you will use a stripped-back version of Agile via Kanban boards and, during the coursework, sprint planning and reviews.

## Exercise

You should visit the _Project_ tab on your GitHub repository and set up the Kanban board that you will use to plan your lab sessions and, ultimately, manage the development of your coursework.

1. Open a browser and go to your GitHub account. From the **Projects** tab, click on _New project_. Select _Board_, and _Create_. Name it howsoever you choose
2. Create two new columns: 1. _Backlog_, and 2. _In Review_ and order them as in Figure 1
3. Now you can add items to the Backlog (you could use your Game Design Document for this)
4. When you decide (with your Project Manager- the Module Convenor) that you plan on working on the item in the current sprint, you will move that item into the _ToDo_ column. Once you start working on the item, it moves into the _In Progress_ column. Once you feel it's done, move it into the _In Review_ column - you will review that item in the weekly sprint review that you have with your Project Manager; if they agree the item is done, it will move into the _Done_ column; otherwise, it will move back into the _Todo_ column. In that sprint review meeting, you will also decide on the items you will work on during the next sprint. This process will continue week-by-week until you have completed your (excellent) coursework
