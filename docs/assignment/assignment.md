# Programming for 3D - Assignment

Below is the assignment for Programming for 3D.

## Overview  

Your coursework should incorporate the concepts introduced in the module labs. However, do not copy the module convenor's lab material! Instead, you must produce an _original_ Unity 3D scene with a game element.

You must commit and push your final scene up to the _main_ branch of your GitHub repository _before_ the hand-in date (described on Canvas, but usually sometime around the second week in January) and ensure that the repository remains available until you receive your mark.

You should submit, via [Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/28172), a [video](#the-video) of your scene and an accompanying [report](#the-report).

Please take note of the [marking criteria](./markingCriteria.md) for the assignment.

## The Assignment

Continue enhancing the scene you have developed in the labs during weeks 1 to 5, which features a two-story building. You should add a third-person controller (TPC), which starts the scene positioned on the first floor of your building. Your TPC should leave that building through a set of doors on the ground floor, which must open and close behind them. The world the TPC enters through those doors should suit the look and feel of the building you've created. There, they must play a game. That game must feature some object(s) that you spawn, which the TPC must pick up; otherwise, you are free to use your imagination and create whatever game you wish! Ultimately, your scene should feature all the concepts introduced in the labs, i.e. modelling, materials, lighting, physics, multimedia, particle systems and animations and an element of scripting (the game you create will require scripts). And it should sound compelling!

### The Scene

Your scene and game should demonstrate the concepts introduced throughout the module:

- [Week 2, Session 1 - Modelling](/docs/labs/week2Session1.md)
- [Week 2, Session 2 - Materials, Shaders and Textures](/docs/labs/week2Session2.md)
- [Week 3, Session 1 - Lighting](/docs/labs/week3Session1.md)
- [Week 3, Session 2 - 3D Physics](/docs/labs/week3Session2.md)
- [Week 4, Session 1 - Multimedia](/docs/labs/week4Session1.md)
- [Week 4, Session 2 - Particle Systems](/docs/labs/week4Session2.md)
- [Week 5, Session 1 - Animations](/docs/labs/week5Session1.md)
- [Week 5, Session 2 - Scripting](/docs/labs/week5Session2.md)

You will get extra marks for introducing creative elements; that could be by creating a lasting impression by introducing features such as surprise or emotion. You will also get extra marks for incorporating some advanced techniques beyond that covered in the labs, thus demonstrating a research element to your work.

You must have modelled the two-story building yourself; in particular, you must refrain from using the building demonstrated in the lab videos! Otherwise, you can use any free or open-source resources you find, but you must reference them properly in your [report](#the-report). An excellent place to find resources would be the free assets on the [Unity store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) because they have been referenced throughout the labs.

You are free to use models in your scene that you have produced using applications such as [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) or [Maya](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/maya/overview), but you will receive no extra marks for having done so.

Finally, if you download a TPC (instead of writing your own), you must replace its character model with one you either download or a model you create yourself. The TPC model should suit the look and feel of the world in which it is placed (unless the storyline/narrative you create in the introduction of your [report](#the-report) justifies why it is different).

### The Video

Record a video (of between two and three minutes) that shows your TPC exploring the scene and playing the game. It must include the following:

1. Start the scene with your TPC on the first floor of your two-story building and use up to thirty seconds of your video exploring that building. Demonstrate the features you implemented and show any unique elements
2. Leave the building through a door on the ground floor and show that door opening and closing behind the TPC
3. The TPC should explore the world created around the two-story building. The look and feel of that world should match the building, and it should include, at a minimum, models, materials, lighting, physics, multimedia, particle systems, and audio. Again, the idea is to demonstrate your implemented features and highlight unique elements!
4. Show the TPC completing (or failing, or both) the game you've built. That game must include some object(s) you spawn and pick up; otherwise, you can use your imagination and create whatever game you wish!

### The Report

Write a report that documents the work you have done. It should be no longer than three thousand words, and ideally, it will include the following:

1. An introduction that describes a storyline/narrative that sets the foundation for the scene you've created and the game your TPC plays
2. A project planning section. That could include the Kanban boards that you should have been creating from the very start of the module
3. A design section, which might include a class design of the scripts implementing your game, as well as any sketches or early models of your building and scene
4. A snippet of a script you used in your game, alongside an explanation of that script and how it was used
5. A properly referenced research element that goes above and beyond the material taught in the labs. That should include how you used that element in your Unity scene, thus making it unique
6. A summary of the Unity scene and game you created. This section is an opportunity to critique what you've done
7. Future work. A short description of how your scene and game could progress beyond this coursework
8. Appendices. Including, at the very minimum:
    A. A link to your GitHub repository
    B. Your scripts
    C. References to any assets you used
    D. Report References

You may use the [report template](./reportTemplate.md) to get you started.
