# Programming for 3D - Assignment

Below is the assignment for Programming for 3D.

## Overview  

You must produce an _original_ Unity 3D scene, with a game element that incorporates the concepts introduced in the module labs.

You must commit and push your final scene up to the _main_ branch of your GitHub repository _before_ the hand-in date (described on Canvas, but usually sometime around the second week in January) and ensure that the repository remains available until you receive your mark.

You should submit, via [Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/32069), a [video](#the-video) of between two and three minutes that showcases your game and a [report](#the-report) of between two and three thousand words that describe what you've done. Your video must include a cutscene that features the model you began in [week 2](../labs/week2Session22024.md).

Please take note of the [marking criteria](./markingCriteria.md) for the assignment.

## The Assignment

Continue enhancing the scene you have developed in the labs during weeks 1 to 7, which should demonstrate the core concepts of a 3D space that were introduced throughout the module:

- [Week 2, session 2 - Modelling](../labs/week2Session22024.md)
- [Week 3, Session 1 - Materials, Textures and Shaders](../labs/week3Session12024.md)
- [Week 3, Session 2 - Lighting](../labs/week3Session22024.md)
- [Week 4, Session 1 - 3D Physics](../labs/week4Session12024.md)
- [Week 4, Session 2 - Scripting](../labs/week4Session22024.md)
- [Week 5, Session 1 - Multimedia](../labs/week5Session12024.md)
- [Week 5, Session 2 - Animations](../labs/week5Session22024.md)

Your scene must include some structure you have modelled yourself and some third-person controller (TPC).

You are free to use your imagination and create whatever game you wish, but you should revisit and revise your [Game Design Document (GDD)](../labs/week1Session22024.md), and implement some of the game ideas described there.

Your game must have some clear objective for the player and should include some decision-making that allows the player to control their destiny. You should reward the player. The game should feature some interaction with an AI-driven entity (be they friend or foe) and some interaction with an object you spawn into the scene. There should be a cutscene and some form of [VFX particle system](../labs/week6Session12024.md). The game _must_ include an element of scripting and should _sound_ compelling.

You will get extra marks for introducing creative elements, which could be by creating a lasting impression by introducing features such as surprise or emotion. You will also get extra marks for incorporating some advanced techniques beyond what is covered in the labs, thus demonstrating a research element in your work.

Aside from modelling your structure, you can use any free or open-source resources you find, but you must reference them properly in your [report](#the-report). The free assets on the [Unity store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) are an excellent place to find resources because they have been referenced throughout the labs.

Finally, if you download a TPC (instead of writing your own), you must replace its character model with one you either download or a model you create yourself. The TPC model should suit the look and feel of the world in which it is placed (unless your storyline/narrative justifies why it is different).

### The Video

Your video should be between two and three minutes long, and it should feature your TPC playing the game. It must include a cutscene featuring the model of the structure you began in [week 2](../labs/week2Session22024.md). Ideally, it would help to put some thought into your video so it looks great. It should sound great, too, but the audio should be from the game (and not overdubbed).

### The Report

Your report should document the work you have done. It should be between two and three thousand words, and ideally, it will include the following:

1. An introduction that describes a storyline/narrative that sets the foundation for the scene you've created and the game your TPC plays. You should use your GDD as inspiration here
2. A project planning section. That will include the Kanban boards you will create when employing the [Agile Project Management](../labs/week2Session12024.md) to deliver your coursework
3. A modelling section, which describes the structure you built, including any textures and lighting
4. Some description of how you used 3D physics in your scene
5. A snippet of a script you used in your game, alongside an explanation of that script and how it was used
6. A section on multimedia and how you enhanced your scene using sound
7. A highlight section that shows where you went above and beyond the material taught in the labs. That should include how you used that element in your Unity scene, thus making it unique
8. A summary of the Unity scene and game you created. This section is an opportunity to critique what you've done
9. Future work. A short description of how your scene and game could progress beyond this coursework
10. Appendices. Including, at the very minimum:
 A. Your GDD
 B. A link to your source-code repository
 C. Your scripts
 D. References to any assets you used
 F. Report References

To get started, you can use the [report template](./reportTemplate.md).
