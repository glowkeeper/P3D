## Lecture Overview

+ Overview of P3D
+ Learning Outcomes
+ Lab Sessions
+ Coursework
+ Academic Integrity
+ Resources

## Overview of P3D

+ Intensive and wide-ranging overview of 3D programming, using [Unity](https://unity.com/)
+ Plan the delivery of a game that demonstrates the core concepts of a 3D environment
+ Includes a research element in the form of a report that resembles that required for your final-year projects and dissertations

- - -

## Learning Outcomes

+ Understand the core elements of virtual 3D environments
+ Use source-code control to manage complex software
+ Use project management principles
+ Create a well-written, coherent, research-based academic report
+ Implement the components of a fully-functional game

- - -

## Lab Sessions

The first six-to-seven weeks of P3D is where you work on directed lab sessions.

**The work you complete in the labs will form the basis for your coursework**.

- - -

Labs in person in the MAC lab in room CHI1-204/205 (Lab 3) at the following times:

+ Tuesday: 9 - 11 **or** 3 - 5
+ Wednesday: 9 - 11 **or** 11 - 1

You should come to one lab on Tuesday and one lab on Wednesday.

- - -

Shortly before the first lab session on Tuesday and the first lab session on Wednesday, a document containing a link to a YouTube tutorial video will be published to [P3D's GitHub site](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D). The document introduces the subject area for that lab, and the video demonstrates the lab's core concepts.

**You must use that video as inspiration for your game**.

- - -

Each lab begins with a brief online Zoom meeting, where the Module Convenor introduces the lab and answers any questions you may have. That will take no more than 15 minutes, after which, they will head down to Lab 3 and distribute the Lab PIN.

## Coursework

From weeks seven or eight to eleven of P3D, you carry out your coursework (unlike for G6078, Game Design and Development, the coursework for P3D is **individual**).

- - -

I give you a brief for your coursework; then it runs like a commercial project where I act as the project manager. Every week, you meet with me for 10 minutes, where we discuss what you've done and plan what you will do next.

- - -

In other words, your coursework exposes you to _agile_ project management using concepts such as _Kanban boards_ and _Sprints_.

- - -

You will be split into two groups. The intention is for one group to come to one of Tuesday's labs and the other to one of Wednesday's. You _can_ come along on both days, but you probably won't need to if you engage properly with the agile process!

- - -

**The coursework evolves from the work you do in the labs**.

- - -

## Academic Integrity

+ [Academic Integrity Expectations](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/skills-hub/referencing-and-academic-integrity#main)
+ [Academic Misconduct Procedures](https://student.sussex.ac.uk/complaints/against-you/misconduct)

- - -

It is acceptable to use Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to help you with this module. However:

+ You must include in your coursework report how, e.g. which tool, what prompt and for what it was used
+ **Such permissions are for P3D only**

- - -

AI will be used to help generate actionable feedback for your assessments, via [_Mark_](https://mark.education/).
