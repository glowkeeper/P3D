# Lecture Overview

+ Overview of P3D
+ Learning Outcomes
+ Lab Sessions
+ Coursework

# Overview of P3D

+ Intensive introduction to 3D programming, using [Unity](https://unity.com/)
+ Plan the delivery of software focused on the core concepts of a 3D environment
+ Includes a research element in the form of a report similar to that required for your final projects

- - -

# Learning Outcomes

+ Understand and implement the core elements of virtual 3D environments
+ Use project management principles, allowing you to deliver successful applications on time
+ Create a well-written, coherent, research-based report

# Lab Sessions

The first half of P3D is where you work on directed lab sessions.

**The work you complete in the labs will form the basis for your Coursework**.

- - -

# Lab Sessions (contd)

Labs in person in CHI1-015 (Lab 2), Tuesday and Thursday, 11 - 1. However, I will begin each lab with a brief online Zoom session, where I will say hello, release the lab PIN, and answer any questions.

Please come to both sessions!

- - -

# Lab Sessions (contd)

Shortly before each lab, I will release on the [P3D GitHub repo](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D) a document and a link to a video where I demonstrate my version of the work to be done. _You must use that video for inspiration for your OWN WORK_!

# Lab Sessions (contd)

+ Dependencies
+ Agile Project Management
+ Modelling
+ Meshes, Materials, Textures and Shaders
+ Lighting

# Lab Sessions (contd)

+ 3D Physics
+ Scripting
+ Animations
+ Particle Systems
+ 3D Audio

# Coursework

In the second half of P3D, you carry out your Coursework (unlike for G6078, Game Design and Development, the Coursework for P3D is **individual**).

**The Coursework builds on the lab materials**.

You will be split into two groups - The intention is for one group to come to Tuesday's lab and the other to Thursday's. However, _you may come to both_!

- - -

# Coursework (contd)

I give you a brief for your Coursework; then it runs like a commercial project where I act as the project manager. Every week, you meet with me for 10 minutes, where we discuss what you've done and plan what you will do next.

- - -

# Coursework (contd)

In other words, your Coursework exposes you to _agile_ project management using concepts such as _Kanban boards_ and _Sprints_.
