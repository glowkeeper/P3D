# Overview of P3D

The first half of P3D involves my demonstrating some of the core concepts of Unity.

Labs online, Monday and Friday, 3 - 5.

Please come to both sessions!

# Overview of P3D (cont'd)

The second half of P3D is where you carry out your coursework (unlike for G6078, Game Design and Development, the coursework for P3D is **individual**).

During the second half of the module, I will split the class into two groups - The intention is for one group to come to Monday's lab, the other, to Friday's. However, _you may come to both_!

# Individual Projects

You get exposure to _agile_ project management using concepts such as _kanban boards_ and _sprints_.

I give you a brief, then I run the coursework like a commercial project where I act as the project manager; every week, you meet with me for 10 minutes to discuss what you've done and plan what you're going to do next.
