# Overview of P3D

+ This module provides you with an intensive introduction to 3D computer programming, using [Unity](https://unity.com/)
+ It covers the planning and delivery of a programming project and the core concepts of creating a 3D environment, including graphics and audio
+ It also includes a research element in the form of a report similar to that required for your final projects, thus helping you succeed there, too

- - -

# Learning Outcomes

+ Understand the core elements of virtual 3D environments
+ Be able to implement the core elements within an interactive 3D application
+ Follow fundamental programming principles, enabling you to produce better, more robust software
+ Use project management principles, allowing you to deliver successful applications
+ Create a well-written, coherent, research-based report

# Lesson Plan

The first half of P3D is where you work on lab sessions.

**The work you complete in the labs will form the basis for your coursework**.

- - -

# Lab Sessions

Labs in person in CHI114, Monday and Friday, 3 - 5. Shortly before each lab, I will release a document and video, via the [P3D GitHub repo](https://github.com/glowkeeper/P3D), which describes the work.

Please come to both sessions!

- - -

# Lab Sessions (cont'd)

+ Set up dependencies
+ Agile project management
+ Modelling
+ First-Person Controllers
+ Lighting
+ Meshes, Materials, Textures and Shaders
+ 3D Physics
+ Scripting
+ Animations
+ Particle Systems
+ 3D Audio

# Coursework

The second half of P3D is where you carry out your coursework (unlike for G6078, Game Design and Development, the coursework for P3D is **individual**). **The courswork builds on the lab materials**.

Here, I will split the class into two groups - The intention is for one group to come to Monday's lab, the other, to Friday's. However, _you may come to both_!

- - -

# Coursework (cont'd)

Your coursework gives you exposure to _agile_ project management using concepts such as _kanban boards_ and _sprints_.

I give you a brief for your coursework, then we run it like a commercial project where I act as the project manager; every week, you meet with me for 10 minutes to discuss what you've done and plan what you're going to do next.
