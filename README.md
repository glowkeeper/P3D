# Programming for 3D

Welcome to Programming for 3D (P3D), a module run at the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/).

This module supports the university's [staff and student charter and guiding principles](/docs/staffStudentCharter.pdf).

## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and you should create a private repository for your P3D work (as that is where you'll post lab exercises and coursework). If not all of that makes sense now, don't worry - it will after the first lab session when you will create that repository and add the [Module Convenor](#maintainer) as a collaborator (so they can support you throughout the module).
- You will need the latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

## Labs

Links to P3D lab sessions will appear below.

## Assignment

A link to the P3D assignment will appear here.

## Background Material

P3D is an practical module where you get to build a complex 3D environment, using [Unity](https://unity.com/) - some familiarity with 3D environments is useful, but not entirely necessary as the labs explain all the concepts required. However, as you immerse yourself in the 3D space, you may wish to deepen your knowledge by grasping some of the theretical underpinnings of the space. Indeed, the module used to be much more theoretical (and less practical), so some of the background material from then has been retained for reference:

- [Advanced Ray Tracing](./docs/advancedRayTracing.pdf)
- [Light and Colour Perception](./docs/lightAndColourPerception.pdf)
- [Vectors](./docs/vectors.pdf).

Additionally, your [Module Convenor](#maintainer) has collated some theoretical background to graphics, here:

- [Graphics Background](./docs/graphicsBackground.md)

For those interested in the maths of a 3D space, there's a nice treatment available here: [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/), which uses a Javascript library called [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to demonstrate its principles. However, don't panic if you're not familiar with javascript, as you do not necessarily need that familiarity to understand the concepts explained at [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/).
