## Dependencies

P3D has some dependencies.

- You should have an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/) and you should create a private repository for your P3D work (as that is where you'll post lab exercises and coursework). If not all of that makes sense now, don't worry - it will after the first lab session when you will create that repository and add the [Module Convenor](#maintainer) as a collaborator (so they can support you throughout the module).
- You will need the latest long term support release of [Unity](https://unity3d.com/unity/qa/lts-releases).

## Labs

Links to P3D lab sessions will appear below.

- [Week 1, Session 1 - Welcome](/docs/labs/week1Session1.md)

## Assignment

The assignment will be released sometime around Week 6 or Week 7.

## Background Material

There is some background material to the module in the [docs](./docs/) folder, including [3D Graphics](./docs/graphicsBackground.md), [advanced ray tracing](./docs/advancedRayTracing.pdf), [light and colour perception](./docs/lightAndColourPerception.pdf) and some useful material about the [maths underpinning a 3D space](./docs/vectors.pdf).
